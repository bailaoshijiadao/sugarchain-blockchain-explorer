SugarChain Explorer - 1.7.4
================

An open source block explorer written in node.js.

### Requires

*  node.js >= 8.17.0 (12.14.0 is advised for updated dependencies)
*  mongodb 4.2.x
*  *coind

### nvm install
	
	sudo apt-get update
	cd && curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.9/install.sh | bash

	vim /etc/profile

Append at the end of the file

	export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
	[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
	[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
	
Then `:wq` save and re source the file

	source /etc/profile

### Nodejs install

	nvm install v12.14.0

### MongoDB install

	sudo apt-get install -y libcurl4 openssl
	sudo apt-get install gnupg
	wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
	echo "deb https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/mongodb/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl start mongod

### Create database

Enter MongoDB cli:

    $ mongo

Create databse:

    > use explorerdb

Create user with read/write access:

    > db.createUser( { user: "mongo-user", pwd: "mongo-pwd", roles: [ "readWrite" ] } )
	> exit

### Get the source

    git clone https://github.com/bailaoshijiadao/sugarchain-explorer sugarchain-explorer

### Install node modules

    cd sugarchain-explorer && npm install --production

### Configure

*Make required changes in settings.json*

*dbsettings* *wallet* required

### Start Explorer

    npm start

*Note: mongod must be running to start the explorer*

As of version 1.4.0 the explorer defaults to cluster mode, forking an instance of its process to each cpu core. This results in increased performance and stability. Load balancing gets automatically taken care of and any instances that for some reason die, will be restarted automatically. For testing/development (or if you just wish to) a single instance can be launched with

    node --stack-size=10000 bin/instance

To stop the cluster you can use

    npm stop

### Syncing databases with the blockchain

sync.js (located in scripts/) is used for updating the local databases. This script must be called from the explorers root directory.

    Usage: node scripts/sync.js [database] [mode]

    database: (required)
    index [mode] Main index: coin info/stats, transactions & addresses
    market       Market data: summaries, orderbooks, trade history & chartdata

    mode: (required for index database only)
    update       Updates index from last sync to current block
    check        checks index for (and adds) any missing transactions/addresses
    reindex      Clears index then resyncs from genesis to current block

    notes:
    * 'current block' is the latest created block when script is executed.
    * The market database only supports (& defaults to) reindex mode.
    * If check mode finds missing data(ignoring new data since last sync),
      index_timeout in settings.json is set too low.
	  
use different terminals
	
	cd sugarchain-explorer
	rm -f ./tmp/index.pid
	node scripts/sync.js index update

*It is recommended to have this script launched via a cronjob at 1+ min intervals.*

**crontab**

*Note: Set scheduled tasks after sync is completed*

*Example crontab; update index every minute and market data every 2 minutes*

    */1 * * * * cd /path/to/explorer && /usr/bin/nodejs scripts/sync.js index update > /dev/null 2>&1
    */2 * * * * cd /path/to/explorer && /usr/bin/nodejs scripts/sync.js market > /dev/null 2>&1

*for Example*

	*/1 * * * * rm -f ./tmp/index.pid && cd /root/sugarchain-explorer && node scripts/sync.js index update && node scripts/sync.js market && node scripts/peers.js > /dev/null 2>&1

### Wallet

Iquidus Explorer is intended to be generic, so it can be used with any wallet following the usual standards. The wallet must be running with atleast the following flags

    -daemon -txindex
    
### Security

Ensure mongodb is not exposed to the outside world via your mongo config or a firewall to prevent outside tampering of the indexed chain data. 

### Known Issues

**script is already running.**

If you receive this message when launching the sync script either a) a sync is currently in progress, or b) a previous sync was killed before it completed. If you are certian a sync is not in progress remove the index.pid and db_index.pid from the tmp folder in the explorer root directory.

    rm tmp/index.pid
    rm tmp/db_index.pid

**exceeding stack size**

    RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

Nodes default stack size may be too small to index addresses with many tx's. If you experience the above error while running sync.js the stack size needs to be increased.

To determine the default setting run

    node --v8-options | grep -B0 -A1 stack_size

To run sync.js with a larger stack size launch with

    node --stack-size=[SIZE] scripts/sync.js index update

Where [SIZE] is an integer higher than the default.

*note: SIZE will depend on which blockchain you are using, you may need to play around a bit to find an optimal setting*
